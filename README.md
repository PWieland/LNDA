## LNDA
Low Noise Differential Amplifier with JFET Input

This project is inspired by the Stanford Research SR560 Low Noise Voltage Preamplifier,
featured in "The Art of Electronics" by Horowitz & Hill (somewhat of a must-have for analog engineers).

What LNDA is: A DIY project aimed at building high-end test and measurement equipment on a budget.

What LNDA is NOT: A product with certified performance and proven track record. Although I have assembled
and tested multiple prototypes, the performance is at the very edge of what I can realiably quantify with my limited equipment.

It features an improved implementation of the base topology with lower noise, lower BOM cost
and reduced footprint, made possible by the extensive use of SMD technology. After SMD
assembly the entire board may be cleaned before mounting of the electromechanical TH
components such as relays and trim-potentiometers. No hard-to-solder components!

Compatible with either JFE2140 or LSK389/489 as input JFET.
