#Low Noise Differential Amplifier with JFET Input

This project is inspired by the Stanford Research SR560 Low Noise Voltage Preamplifier,
featured in "The Art of Electronics" by Horowitz & Hill (a great book you should own).

It features an improved implementation of the base topology with lower noise, lower BOM
and reduced footprint, made possible by the extensive use of SMD technology. After SMD
assembly the entire board may be cleaned before mounting of the electromechanical TH
components such as relays and trim-potentiometers. No hard-to-solder components!

Compatible with either JFE2140 or LSK389/489 as input JFET.
